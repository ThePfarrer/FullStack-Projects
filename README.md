# FullStack-Projects

> “Good artists copy, great artists steal.” - Pablo Picasso

Taking a leaf from Picasso, the goal of this repo is to challenge me to learn ReactJs, Scala and PostgreSQL. To do this I decided to recreate the projects found in [Full-Stack React Projects - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/product/full-stack-react-projects-second-edition/9781839215414).

The initial projects were created using the MERN Stack. ReactJS on the front-end, NodeJS and ExpressJS on the back-end and MongoDB as database.
